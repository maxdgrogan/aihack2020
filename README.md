# Drug consumption prediction for NHS

Done as a project at [AIHack 2020](https://aihack.org/) at Imperial College London.

#### Motivation

As life expectancy increases, it is crucial to improve the quality of life among the elderly. As people age, they are more prone to having health issues and degenerative diseases such as cancer, dementia, infections due to viruses and bacteria. Osteoporosis and arthritis affecting the bones and joints, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimerâ€™s and Parkinson's, cancer, and diabetes are among the most common degenerative disease.

Our project is aimed at measuring correlations between different diseases in regions in the UK. We buolt a dataset consisting of time-series data consisting of the number of prescriptions per GP in the UK and we attempt to predict thwat is going to be the monthly consumption for specific medicine per GP.

2. [Method](#Method)
3. [Visualisation](#Visualisation) 

To run our project proceed to [Running](#Running) and the contributions are all summarised in `tutorial.ipynb` inside the root of the project. 

## Dataset

## Method

Our method is a multi-layered **Recurrent neural network** that is trained through backpropagation. We are able to estimate the uncertainty of our predictions through Bayesian inference that is provided through using [MC Dropout](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.05287.pdf).

## Visualisation

### Running

#### Requirements

The requirements to run the code are in `requirements.txt`. The required libraries are:

```
numpy
ipykernel
scipy
sklearn
seaborn
pytorch
```

To install them create a virtual environemnt for Python>=3.6 with:

```
virtualenv -p python3 venv
source venv/bin/activate 
```

And install the dependecies with: 

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running 

Running is just as easy. Make sure that you have insalled all the libraries and then the tutorial is in [`tutorial.ipynb`](tutorial.ipynb). You can run it comfortably in a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) environment with:

```
jupyter notebook
```
